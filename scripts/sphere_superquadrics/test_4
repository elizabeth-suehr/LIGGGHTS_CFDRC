WARNING: 
	The contact model you specified is not located in any whitelist.
	Because of this the model will be run in an unoptimized version (increasing runtime by up to 20%).
	In order to optimize this model you have the following options:
		(i)  Run the genAutoExamplesWhitelist.sh script in your LIGGGHTS(R) source folder to automatically parse the input script
		(ii) Add the model combination by hand to your style_contact_model_user.whitelist that can be found in your LIGGGHTS(R) source folder
		(iii) Use the ENABLE_MODEL_* flag when building with cmake.
	If you perform one of the steps above LIGGGHTS(R) needs to be recompiled to generate the optimized code.
