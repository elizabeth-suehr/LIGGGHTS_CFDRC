I do not know how licensing work, please email me if you see anything

## How To Use!
Example init files are in the examples folder under the LEBC_public folder.
The only thing new is the fix lebc command at the end. 

## Warnings
This is not a confirmed/validated code, but it appears to be working. If it at any point is validated I will update this to point to the paper or documentation
